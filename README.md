## planned things (spoilers haha):
 • red ralsei, purple scarff, fireball spell, will keep "raise up your bat" lyrics unchanged;  
 • king is now "the chain of justice";  
 • Susie actually kills lancer in prison;  
 • The knight appears at the end of chapter 2 like spamton neo, you fight them with no ralsei and on weird route with no susie;  
 • spamton uses fancy text like tenna;  
 • queen is now empress (old design);  
 • rudest buster?;  
 • insans;  
 • clover is now undertale yellow clover;  
 • some joke prophesies like "Kris will sing swears" and something about school project  
 • knight room instead of mike room
